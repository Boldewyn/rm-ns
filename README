                                remove namespace

These files provide possibilities to remove elements and attributes from an XML
document, that are in a certain, defined namespace.

Consider you have an XHTML document with math formulas in the MathML namespace.
For some reason, you want the formulas stripped out of the file. Nothing
simpler than that! Use the tools provided by this project and enjoy.

P a r a m e t e r s :
=====================

* namespace: The namespace whose elements and attributes are to be removed.

* copy-children: If true, the children of matching elements will be copied.
  Otherwise, they will be erased, too. Default is 'true'.

* remove-attributes: This parameter controls, if attributes are removed, too.
  Attributes are per definitionem in the empty namespace, as long as they are
  not explicitly, that is, with a prefix, bound to a namespace. That means,
  that if elements in the empty namespace should be removed, most of the
  attributes of other elements will vanish as well. This parameter allows to
  address this problem. Default is 'true'.

B e h a v i o u r :
===================

* If the root element is bound to the namespace, that should be removed, the
  result could be invalid XML. Therefore the whole document is embedded in a
  new root element <root /> in the empty namespace.
